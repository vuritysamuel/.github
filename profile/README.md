Hi, Iâ€™m Samuel ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Data Science graduate student and Data Analytics Intern, passionate about building impactful data-driven solutions. This GitHub space is where I showcase my work â€“ from real-time ETL pipelines to predictive modeling and public health analytics â€“ all aimed at driving meaningful insights and impact.

ðŸš€ Projects
	â€¢	Home Credit Default Risk Assessment | Python, LightGBM, XGBoost, scikit-learn â€“ Developed and tuned models on a 300K lending dataset, improving AUC-ROC from 0.85 to 0.92. Reduced misclassification rates by 15%, enhancing risk mitigation strategies in loan default predictions. (Project link coming soon)
	â€¢	Cloud-Based ETL Workflow for E-Commerce Insights | SQL, AWS Glue, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3 â€“ Architected a scalable serverless ETL pipeline for 1GB of daily e-commerce data. This workflow cut data ingestion time by 40% through automated transformations and event-driven Lambda triggers, enabling faster and more reliable business intelligence. (Project link coming soon)
	â€¢	Bayesian Public Health Risk Modeling | PyMC3, Bayesian Inference â€“ Built a Bayesian model on STD case data from 60 counties to identify high-risk areas. The modelâ€™s insights have influenced public health decision-making by guiding teams to focus resources where theyâ€™re needed most. (Project link coming soon)
	â€¢	Retail Demand Forecasting | Python, PyTorch (Time Series) â€“ Engineered a real-time demand forecasting model for retail inventory planning. The model improved forecast accuracy by 10%, helping reduce potential revenue loss by over $100K through better stock management. (Project link coming soon)
