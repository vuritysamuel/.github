# Hello,
I’m Samuel, a Data Analytics Intern at the BroadStreet Institute. I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and a Master’s in Data Science. With internship experiences in a range of domains like Healthcare Analytics, Retail E-Commerce, and Marketing Analytics, I'm adept at building efficient systems and asking the right questions to solve complex Business Problems.

## What I'm *Really* Good at
- **Full-Stack Data Expertise** – I write efficient, optimized code in Python and advanced SQL, I'm experienced in building scalable pipelines (Airflow) and deploying models on cloud platforms (AWS). I excel in supervised learning (XGBoost, Random Forests), model tuning (GridSearchCV), and time-series analysis (ARIMA), and have hands-on PyTorch experience. 
- **Extensive Domain Knowledge & Business Acumen** – I bring real-world experience in healthcare, e-commerce, and marketing, paired with project work in fintech, sports analytics, cloud solutions, and sales. I excel at asking the right questions, collaborating with stakeholders, and delivering solutions that align with industry needs and regulations.
- **Impactful Data Solutions** – I am learning how to build high-stakes solutions, with work on Bayesian models (PyMC3) for public health risk(BroadStreet Institute) and PyTorch forecasting (TFT) for boosting inventory accuracy (People Tech Group), I am learning to confidently take on harder challenges and produce production-level results.
- **End-to-End Project Delivery** – I can build clean datasets from messy ones (Kinesis, Pandas), craft models (see above), and am adept at deploying real-time dashboards (Power BI)—turning data into clear, actionable insights for stakeholders like county officials.
