# Hello,
I’m Samuel, a Data Analytics Intern at the BroadStreet Institute based in Chicago, IL. I hold a Bachelor’s in Computer Science and a Master’s in Data Science. With internship experiences in Healthcare Analytics, Retail E-Commerce, and Marketing Analytics, I build efficient systems and ask the right questions to drive data-driven insights.

## What I'm Good at
- **Full-Stack Data Expertise** – Proficient in Python and SQL for data wrangling, analysis, and machine learning, with hands-on experience building scalable pipelines (Pandas, Spark) and deploying models on cloud platforms.
- **Extensive Domain Knowledge & Business Acumen** – I blend data skills with domain knowledge in healthcare, E-Commerce, and Marketing, working with complex datasets to find context-rich insights and solutions that align with industry needs and regulations.
